# Better Auth UI

A non-comprehensive set of authentication components to help you get started quickly with Better Auth.

Designed for copy-paste use, these components serve as a starting point and are meant to be customized to suit your specific needs.

The components are not connected to Better Auth out of the box. Instead, they expose handler functions (e.g. `SignUpForm.onSubmit`) so you can wire them up with Better Auth however you like.

## Components

| Component  |  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `SignUpForm`  | IMG  |
| `SignInForm`  | IMG  |
| `RequestPasswordResetForm`  | IMG  |
| `ResetPasswordForm`  | IMG  |
| `UpdateAvatarCard`  | IMG  |

## Dependencies
- `zod`
- `@hookform/resolvers`
-  `react-hook-form`
-  `npx shadcn add form alert button card input`
