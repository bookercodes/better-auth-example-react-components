# Better Auth React Components

A non-comprehensive set of authentication components to help you get started quickly with Better Auth.

Designed for **copy-paste** use, these components serve as a starting point and are meant to be customized to suit your specific needs.

The components are not connected to Better Auth out of the box. Instead, they expose handler functions (e.g. `SignUpForm.onSubmit`) so you can wire them up to your Better Auth instance however you like.

## Components

| Component  |  
| ------------- |
| `SignUpForm`  | 
| `SignInForm`  | 
| `UserDropdown`  | 
| `AuthButtons`  | 

## Installation

``
npm i zod react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers
npx shadcn add form button card input avatar dropdown-menu
```

Happy coding!
