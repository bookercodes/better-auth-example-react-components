# Better Auth UI

Non-comprehensive collection of authentication React components to help you get up and running with Better Auth quickly.

They’re designed to be copied and pasted into your project to help you get  off the ground. The code is meant to be adapted — you’ll likely want to modify the components to fit your specific requirements. 

Built with react-hook-form, zod, and ShadCN UI, each component accepts handler functions so you can connect it to Better Auth.
